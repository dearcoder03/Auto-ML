# Auto ML Clone

This is a simple implementation of an Auto ML clone using TensorFlow.js. It allows you to upload images, train a machine learning model, and see the training progress in real-time.

## Presentation

For a detailed presentation of the project, please check out [this link](https://shorturl.at/3jhYC).

## Features

- Upload multiple images for training
- Train a machine learning model using TensorFlow.js
- Display training progress with a progress bar and training output

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- An internet connection to load TensorFlow.js from CDN

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-ml-clone.git
cd auto-ml-clone
```

### Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the Auto ML functionality.

### Running the Project

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the interface to upload images for different classes.
3. Click on "Train Model" to train the machine learning model.
4. View the training progress and results on the webpage.

- A container for previewing the model and exporting it.

### styles.css

This file contains the CSS styles for the webpage, including:

- Styles for the main containers and buttons.
- Styles for the image previews and progress bar.

### script.js

This file contains the JavaScript logic for the webpage, including:

- Functions for handling image uploads and webcam captures.
- Functions for training the model using TensorFlow.js.
- Functions for updating the progress bar and displaying the training results.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to load TensorFlow.js from the CDN.
